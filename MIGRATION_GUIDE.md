- [ ] User acceptance testing

## Key Changes

### Architecture Changes
1. **From Procedural to MVC**: All functionality moved to proper MVC structure
2. **Routing**: File-based URLs converted to route-based URLs
3. **Database**: Raw PDO queries converted to CodeIgniter's Query Builder and Models
4. **Session Management**: Native PHP sessions replaced with CodeIgniter's session library
5. **Security**: Enhanced with CodeIgniter's built-in security features

### File Structure Mapping

#### Legacy System → CodeIgniter 4
```
├── init.php                    → app/Controllers/BaseController.php (security functions)
├── login.php                   → app/Views/auth/login.php
├── login_process.php           → app/Controllers/AuthController.php
├── dashboard.php               → app/Controllers/DashboardController.php
├── profile.php                 → app/Controllers/ProfileController.php
├── plantilla.php               → app/Controllers/PlantillaController.php
├── myapplications.php          → app/Controllers/LeaveController.php
├── config/db_connection.php    → app/Config/Database.php
└── (various PHP files)         → Organized MVC structure
```

### Security Enhancements
1. **CSRF Protection**: Automatically handled by CodeIgniter
2. **Input Validation**: Centralized validation rules
3. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Query Builder prevents SQL injection
4. **XSS Protection**: Built-in output escaping
5. **Session Security**: Enhanced session management

### Database Changes
- All database queries converted to use CodeIgniter's Query Builder
- Model-based approach for data operations
- Proper validation and sanitization
- Relationship management through models

## Migration Benefits

### For Developers
1. **Maintainability**: Clear MVC structure makes code easier to maintain
2. **Scalability**: Framework provides better foundation for growth
3. **Security**: Built-in security features reduce vulnerabilities
4. **Testing**: Framework supports unit testing and debugging
5. **Documentation**: Better code organization and documentation

### For Users
1. **Improved UI**: Modern, responsive interface with TailwindCSS
2. **Better Performance**: Optimized queries and caching
3. **Enhanced Security**: Stronger protection against attacks
4. **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works on all devices
5. **Consistent Experience**: Unified interface across all features

## Implementation Notes

### Coexistence Strategy
- Both systems can run simultaneously during migration
- Bridge file redirects legacy URLs to new CI4 routes when available
- Gradual migration allows testing of individual components
- Database remains unchanged, ensuring data integrity

### URL Structure
- Legacy: `/dashboard.php` → CI4: `/ci4/public/dashboard`
- Legacy: `/plantilla.php?search=manager` → CI4: `/ci4/public/plantilla?search=manager`
- Parameters and functionality preserved

### Session Compatibility
- Session data structure maintained for compatibility
- Enhanced security without breaking existing sessions
- Smooth transition for logged-in users

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Phase
1. Test CI4 components alongside legacy system
2. Compare functionality and performance
3. Fix any compatibility issues
4. User acceptance testing

### Production Deployment
1. Deploy CI4 system in subdirectory
2. Update .htaccess to redirect specific routes
3. Monitor system performance
4. Gradually migrate remaining components
5. Full cutover once all components verified

## Technical Specifications

### System Requirements
- PHP 8.1 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher
- Apache with mod_rewrite enabled
- Minimum 256MB memory limit

### Dependencies
- CodeIgniter 4.6.1+
- TailwindCSS (via CDN)
- Preline UI components
- Existing Composer packages (FPDF, PHPSpreadsheet)

### Performance Improvements
